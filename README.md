# Selenium-Webdriver-with-PYTHON-from-Scratch-Frameworks

A starter automation framework using Selenium WebDriver with Python. This project demonstrates Python basics, data types, and simple scripting as a foundation for building robust web testing frameworks. The structure is designed for learning and extending with PyTest and the Page Object Model.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── DataType.py         # Python list and tuple operations demo
├── FirstDemo.py        # Python basics: variables, strings, types
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── .idea/              # IDE configuration files (PyCharm/VSCode)
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   `git clone <repo-url>`

2. **Run the demo scripts**  
   - To run the data type demo:
     ```sh
     python DataType.py
     ```
   - To run the first Python demo:
     ```sh
     python FirstDemo.py
     ```

3. **Explore and Extend**  
   - Use these scripts as a base for learning Python and Selenium automation.
   - Extend with PyTest and Page Object Model patterns for scalable test automation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or compatible version
- (Optional) PyCharm or VSCode for development

## Notes

- The `.idea/` folder contains IDE settings and can be ignored for most users.
- The scripts demonstrate basic Python concepts and are intended for educational purposes.
